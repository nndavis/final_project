Never working here.","Bully culture, discrimination, homophobic and racist. 
Management are the worst I’ve ever come across. No empathy, couldn’t care less. 
Workload is mentally and physically unmanageable, impossible timeframes and absolute chaos. 
Customers are the rudest I’ve ever came across.
No work life/home balance. Minimum contracts, higher contracts always promised but nothing ever comes of it. Extra hours are not always available and inconsistent but still expected to work over 60 hours at Christmas. 
Pay has been so misconceived by outside sources. The pay is actually awful, they never pay you right. Always feels like they dock you and leave out hours of pay. You are too exhausted at this point to even care or figure it out though. If you leave, they don’t pay you at all so don’t work notice. Just leave on payday, go work at Tesco for 10p less and without a workload of 5 robots. 
No advancement opportunities, most managers are 15 to 20 years in, in their mid 40s or 50s and the area managers who boss them about are straight out of university 20 year olds. They are clueless and never last even a year. Don’t believe the lies, don’t waste your time. Do not ruin your life. People try to commit suicide on a Monday and get invited to a formal disciplinary hearing on the Tuesday.

Unfair expectations - in the job during store manager time you are expected to anticipate things that are way beyond your experience. When you get to the grading period, you are left to sink or swim regardless of whether you have experienced something before.

Very little of your actual performance or feedback from direct line managers taken into account. Building your  ‘personal brand’ is the primary concern of the company from day one, which encourages people to cosy up to management who will help them through promotion, rather than focussing on building up useful skills. 
- incredibly competitive and toxic culture, particularly in ACG. To be expected when you are ranked against one another during performance review 
- analysts have no say in shaping their career - schedulers and management only care about charge-ability.  If you turn down unsuitable roles you will be penalised. 
- analysts are taken advantage of by senior staff eg forced to work on clients without a chargeable code, which is then used against them at performance review 
- questionable management of the recent redundancy process - Accenture now having to rehire multiple roles, no senior management pay cuts etc

Watch out for when they sell you as a senior consultant and pay you an analyst rate.
No matter how many years you spend (think 7 years), other 'favourits', will get their training paid for, and you won't.
Favourism is a real problem. If you aren't good at selling yourself and talking about your work, and much better at delivering, you'll be overshadowed by management, who will get their bonus for your work, and you'll get nothing, because someone else is claiming your work! And sometimes, you'll have a colleague you know does virtually nothing throughout the day, but spends most of his time having a laugh with management, he gets promoted and you don't :)
This is even worse when you know that you can't represent yourself in promotion meetings, and your senior management (who will usually have no clue what you're doing, thanks to your manager claiming your work), and you won't even get a salary increase beyond 200-300 a year!!
They didn't care to promote women, in 2018 they promoted 5 ppl, all were men! Questioning them, they failed to explain why 2 were promoted over another lady in the team. She was yet another person who wasn't good at selling her work, but she worked hard and everyone knew she was great.

I should write in the Pros that this place, taught me what I'm actually worth the hard way and to not allow them or anyone else to benefit from my work if they won't pay me. Look elsewhere if you're looking to feel valued and not just a number that increases their bonuses.

It's very much a taker culture, full of backstabbing, especially around promotion time. They don't care about people, you are just your employee number. They pay lipservice to all the right things but good luck finding action to actually back it up around things like diversity, work-life balance and mental health. It's mainly marketing, show pony-ism and people stealing other people's ideas while telling them their worth nothing. Disgraceful culture - filled with people who don't even bother to report harassment because they don't feel they'd get much help, particularly if the perpertrators are perceived to be company favourites. Senior people who won't report incidents of people using offensive language around protected characteristics, or intimidating employees who've called these things out (admittedly this seems like a bigger problem in the larger parts of the business), but will go on linkedin and post about their commitment to diversity and promote the completion of conduct surveys, citing that bad behaviour should be called out.

- You cannot possibly drive your own career - forced to take up any role to maintain chargeability, even if you are up for promotion you will be judged by strangers via multiple discussion rounds, opaque talent discussion process - career counsellor puts you up for promotion but at the end you don't end up getting promoted and there is no formal reason/feedback for the same!
- Career heavily dependent on Networking - you can be a rockstar in your client account but if you are not friends with seniors, leads or anyone who sits in the talent discussion rounds - well tough luck! Finding good roles is also based on knowing the 'correct' people. This is stressful and can easily impact the actual work you need to do to excel. Also sometimes this can be very unfair as if a person is not good at their work and do not possess the relevant skills but excellent networking skills as opposed to someone who is actually very good at their work - the latter will always have a disadvantage and can take ages to climb up the ladder.
- No clarity on different streams - people with good technical background and skills start on level 12 and people who have background in music, geography, biology, chemistry, math etc. start at level 11 because Accenture does not appreciate graduates who have computer science degrees and relevant experience!",accenture,accenture.com,1989.0,information technology and services,10001+,"dublin, dublin, ireland",ireland,linkedin.com/company/accenture,190689,455768

- If you're a recent Graduate, don't mind climbing the corporate ladder, love to work anytime of the day and evening, you'll feel at home.","1. Full of office politics;
2. You find yourself living to work rather than working to live;
3. When it comes to performance review time, it gets quite stressful because, it's a sales speech, and most of the times, the one who has actually worked and contributed more don't get promoted, at the end of the day is 'how well the managers or senior managers in your bubble know you';
4. Managers feel like gods and can get very disrespectful and inconsiderate, in many occasions, they've put people on performance improvement simply for not wanting to work overtime or wanting to leave a project they're not happy with;
5. Arrogant leadership;
6. Mediocre pay;
7. Coming from a minority background, On three occasions I've had white managers and team leads happily saying the 'N word' in front of me while others just laughed, which goes without saying the feeling of disrespect felt (Being new and junior in the company I was afraid to speak out), on a different situation, a team lead said to me 'don't go for white girls they don't tend to like big-nosed people' while asking for my dating situation;
8. People at senior level than others feel the need to step/look down on people;
9. You'll find yourself knowing more than someone at a higher level than you, which goes back to point number 3;
10. Unnecessary extra-curricular work which is crucial to getting promoted, the more you do the better, and you easily find yourself not having time for actual client work;
11. Leadership don't care about juniors of Level 11-12, have once been around a group of managers in a pub, a group of junior colleagues (level 11-12) passed by to say 'Hi' after they're gone a manager loudly says 'F-word TAGs' (TAG is the denomination for anyone who's of associate/analyst level). All other managers, team leads, Senior managers simply laughed;
12. No humanity, if you're lucky enough you find yourself in great projects with actual nice people but it's extremely rare, it's easier to find a crypto-wallet full of Bitcoin on the side of the road.
13. Have worked on a Financial services' project with a very lovely and friendly group of Indian developers on ICT visas, the senior managers were the true definition of bullies, on one occasion calling one of the developers (who's around 38-40 years old) dumb and useless in front of the team. Which goes back to point number 5 and 8.
14. Leadership are like presidential candidates, they know how to use their words to keep you at ease.
15. Get ready to be a Yes-Man in order to be promoted

Final Tip: 
 - It's not about working hard, just know your people, make yourself known to managers and senior managers; 
 - Talk a lot even if it doesn't make sense;
 - Make sure you show the personality that's ready to step or disrespect others anytime, it'll show to leadership you're ready to lead.",accenture,accenture.com,1989.0,information technology and services,10001+,"dublin, dublin, ireland",ireland,linkedin.com/company/accenture,190689,455768
