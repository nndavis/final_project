## Authors: Adio Olufemi Peter, Ashlesha Vengareddy, Noah Davis, Ethan Dirksen

Topic:
Take our "Glassdoor Job Reviews" dataset which contains 18 columns: 
1. Firm, 
2. job title, 
3. location, 
4. overall rating, 
5. diversity inclusion, 
6. Culture values, 
7. pros, 
8. cons, 
9. and a few more ratings and things.



final Project topic: can we rate a job's value?


#### source of data:

The  core question is to determine what features best predicts the over all ratings of a jobs. The starting datasets were sourced from Kaggle.

### Questions hope to answer:

From running machine learning code, the team hopes to answer the following questions.

what features best predicts the over all ratings of a job

What are the top 3 factors that impact the overall job rating? 

What do future employees look for in a job?

####  Machine Learning Model:

- Takes in data in from the provisional 
database 
- Outputs label(s) for input data

As far as machine learning goes, our "target" would be overall rating and we would "classify"/train our data off whether or not a job is good or bad. Good being ratings 3+ and bad being 2-. We could use the other 17 columns as features, but we would more than likely thin down the long string columns such as "pros" and "cons" as those would be difficult to turn into numerical values which is necessity for machine learning.



How to train the machine learning model:
Use two datasets. Find things in the sample dataset that indicate a higher overall rating (the rating is 3 or above) and train the model to find what would indicate what makes up a job's overall rating in the test dataset. 

Questions we want answered:
- does location adversely affect diversity inclusion?
- are managers bias in their rating?
- does location affect overall job rating?


#### Database: 
We are going to use PG admin to create databse tables using the data from the merged dataset and then connect to aws cloud for the final database structure. 

 Sample data that mimics the 
expected final database structure or 
schema âœ“ Draft machine learning module is 
connected to the provisional database
