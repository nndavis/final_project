Topic:
Take our "Glassdoor Job Reviews" dataset which contains 18 columns: 
1. Firm, 
2. job title, 
3. location, 
4. overall rating, 
5. diversity inclusion, 
6. Culture values, 
7. pros, 
8. cons, 
9. and a few more ratings and things.

Within this dataset we could ask multiple questions: 
- does location affect overall job rating? , 
- are managers bias in their rating?, 
- does location adversely affect diversity inclusion? etc. 

As far as machine learning goes, our "target" would be overall rating and we would "classify"/train our data off whether or not a job is good or bad. Good being ratings 3+ and bad being 2-. We could use the other 17 columns as features, but we would more than likely thin down the long string columns such as "pros" and "cons" as those would be difficult to turn into numerical values which is necessity for machine learning.
